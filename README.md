# BigInteger


I have implemented a BigInter Library using C language. Here integers are represented as linked lists so that problem of integer overflow can be overcome. Representing integers as linked list can allow us to add as many as digits in a integer The functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus of BigIntegers have been implemented succesfully.

Make sure that all the files are in the same directory.

To compile the program, use the following command in the terminal:

gcc BigInteger.c main.c -o program 

and then:

./program
